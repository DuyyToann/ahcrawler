## Page: Search url

### Search form

Here you can enter a complete url or just a part of it (domain, path, filename, extension).
Example: enter ".css" to find all css files.

### Results

You can get 2 types of results: 

* **exact results** - exact match of a full url\
  Remark: This may sound useless in the first moment. For a manual search it is. But the bookmarklet for a detail page uses the functionality.
* **lazy results** - hits anywhere in the url
  
The results are shown with http status code, place, type and url. If you click to the url you get the detail page.
If you press the button with the arrow it opens the url in a new window.
